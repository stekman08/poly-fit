# TODO

## README improvements

- [ ] Add screenshot of start screen
- [ ] Add gameplay GIF (optional)
- [ ] Add AI attribution section (like neon-flap)

## Difficulty - ideas

### Problems today
- Pieces always start in their "base" orientation, so players learn patterns
- Symmetric shapes (Square, Line) are always easy
- Target shape is random, not designed to be tricky

### Implemented
- [x] Randomize starting orientation for pieces

### To explore

**Easy:**
- [ ] Avoid symmetric shapes (Square, Line4) on higher levels
- [ ] Add more pentominoes with irregular shapes

**Medium:**
- [ ] Generate harder target shapes (holes in middle, irregular edges)
- [ ] Prioritize asymmetric shapes on higher levels

**Hard:**
- [ ] Verify puzzle has only ONE solution
- [ ] Measure "difficulty" - number of orientations? Near-miss placements?

**Philosophical:**
- Balance between "aha!" moments and frustration
- How to know if a puzzle is hard vs just annoying?
